The weather sensor recognizes wind speed and rain, triggering the motorized operator to automatically close the skylight when the conditions are no longer optimal. Then, if connected to the thermostatic control, once the set temperature has been reached and the weather sensor is no longer triggered, the skylight automatically opens to a clear opening of just over 3' to ventilate the residence."
